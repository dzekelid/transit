  frustration over finding a decent parking spot at a ballgame. Between the parking
  lots, garages, and driveway owners renting out space, there were plenty of places
  to park, but no way to know which had open spaces or how much they cost. There had
  to be a better way than driving around aimlessly searching for a spot.nnParkWhiz.com

  or mobile phone before they reach their destination. Parking search results reflect
