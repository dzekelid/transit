  innovative applications for the web or mobile devices. We encourage you to integrate
  Metro data into your applications and mashups to help get people the information
  they want about getting around. Use of our APIs and other data is free of charge,
  you have two options, for new developers who want to try out the WMATA API but are
  not ready for production, and you can use our demonstration key, without having
  to register.
